# Workflow
- Keep plans concise and human-readable, avoid long snippets of code or contradictory statements.
- When asked about something that requires documentation for an open source project, look up this doc using the context7 MCP.
- Be sure to run `pnpm check` when you're done making a series of code changes (does type checking, linting and formatting in all packages)

# Code style
- Prefer using early returns to avoid nesting code in if statements
