# Workflow
- Keep plans concise and human-readable, avoid long snippets of code.
- Run `pnpm check` from the repo root when you're done making a series of code changes. It runs linting, autoformatting and type checking. There is NO NEED to run tsc separately.

# Code style
- Prefer using early returns to avoid nesting code in if/else statements
- Avoid nested ternaries
